# 👋 Hi, I'm Marius Hübbertz (@MariusH-Dev)

👀 **What excites me**:  
I'm passionate about building software that improves everyday life, whether it's small personal tools or larger projects that solve real-world problems. The ability to create meaningful solutions with just a laptop and code never ceases to amaze me.

🌱 **What I'm currently exploring**:  
I am currently delving into C and C++ for embedded systems and microcontroller projects. I also enjoy working on small apps with Swift for iOS/macOS and developing practical tools that add real value to my personal life.

💻 **What I am currently working on**:  
- Programming with C/C++
- Programming with C# 
- Personal app development with Swift  
- Small projects for friends and family that simplify everyday tasks
